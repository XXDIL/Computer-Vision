RUN INSTRUCTIONS:
	I have finished the assignment and the results are in the .ipynb file. The cells are already run so you 
	dont need to run it again. But if you wish to run it the Naive KNN model takes a lot of time (around 30 mins).


CONTENTS : 

	1) utils.py contains all the functions I used for data preprocessing as well as the CNN model.
	2) models folder contains the pretrained models
	3) images folder contains the graphs and the findings in a organised format.
